## Make and update new or edited file to GitHub

What to do:
* Update your local repository by typing the command 'git pull' in Git Bash
* Create file using Git Bash by typing the command 'touch [filename]' 
* Add the file to the Git index by typing the command 'git add -A' in Git Bash (adds new files and updates tracking for renamed and deleted files)
* Commit changes in a file to save as an intermediate version by typing the command 'git commit -m "[description of what you changed]"' in Git Bash. This updates the local repo.
* Update the remote repository on GitHub by typing the command 'git push' in Git Bash
